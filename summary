Summary of what I have learnt about essential Android design principles
1. All Fragment-to-Fragment communication is done through the associated Activity. Two Fragments should never communicate directly.
2. Use Fragments for Navigation Drawer, instead of Activites
3. Nested Fragment cannot use <fragment> tag in XML. Use getChildFragmentManager() to add new Fragment transaction
4. ListView - each item if not inside a layout container, its height is not set properly. Need to use minHeight.
5. Hide ExpandableListView group indicators - android:groupIndicator=@null
6. ScrollView cannot be combined with ListView
